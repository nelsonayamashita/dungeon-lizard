Journey of the Dungeon Lizard is a game heavily inspired by ConcernedApeâ€™s Journey of the Prairie King from Stardew Valley, but instead of a gun, the main character utilizes a sword. You will face multiple waves of different enemies and bosses across all the 11 levels. To aid you in this difficult journey random powers ups will appear, you can also buy upgrades that will be available at the end of specific levels.
